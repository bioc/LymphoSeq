\usage{
<<<<<<< HEAD
phyloTree(list, sample, type = "nucleotide", layout = "rectangular",
  label = TRUE)
=======
phyloTree(list, sample, type = "nucleotide", layout = "rectangular")
>>>>>>> Sync with devel branch
}
\arguments{
\item{list}{A list data frames of unproductive nucleotide sequences or productive 
nucleotide or amino acid sequenes generated by the LymphoSeq function productiveSeq.  
vFamilyName, dFamilyName, jFamilyName, and count are required columns.}

\item{sample}{A character vector indicating the name of the sample in the productive
sequence list.}

\item{type}{A character vector indicating whether "aminoAcid" or "nucleotide" sequences
should be compared.}

\item{layout}{A character vector indicating the tree layout.  Options include 
"rectangular", "slanted", "fan", "circular", "radial" and "unrooted".}
<<<<<<< HEAD

\item{label}{A boolean indicating if the sequencing count should be shown next to the leaves.}
=======
>>>>>>> Sync with devel branch
}
\value{
Returns a phylogenetic tree where each leaf represents a sequence color coded by the
V, D, and J gene usage.  The number next to each leaf refers to the sequence count.  A triangle 
shaped leaf indicates the dominant sequence.  Refer to the ggtree Bioconductor package 
documentation for details on how to manipulate the tree.
}
\description{
Create a phylogenetic tree using neighbor joining tree estimation for amino acid or 
nucleotide CDR3 sequences in a list of data frames.
