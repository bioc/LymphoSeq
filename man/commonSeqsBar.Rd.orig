\arguments{
\item{productive.aa}{A list data frames of of productive amino acid sequences 
generated by LymphoSeq function productiveSeq where the aggregate parameter 
was set to "aminoAcid".}

\item{samples}{The names of two or more samples in the productive.aa 
list whose intersections will shown.}

\item{color.sample}{The name of a single sample in the productive.aa list whose 
sequences will be colored in all samples that they appear in.}

\item{color.intersection}{The names of two or more samples in the productive.aa 
list whose intersections will be colored.}

\item{color}{A character vector of a color name that will be used highlight a selected 
sample or multiple sample intersections.}
<<<<<<< HEAD

\item{labels}{A Boolean indicating whether the number of intersecting sequences should
be shown on the tops of the bars.}
